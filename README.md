# weather-report-chat-bot
1. Import Libraries*:
   - The code begins by importing necessary libraries: nltk for natural language processing tasks, random for generating random responses, requests for making HTTP requests to APIs, and Chat and reflections from nltk.chat.util for creating the chatbot.

2. *Define Patterns and Responses*:
   - The patterns variable contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of a regular expression pattern and a list of possible responses.
   - These patterns define how the chatbot will respond to different types of user inputs.

3. *Create and Train the Chatbot*:
   - The Chat class from nltk.chat.util is used to create the chatbot by passing the defined patterns and reflections.
   - This initializes the chatbot and trains it with the provided patterns.

4. *Define Function to Get Weather Information*:
   - The get_weather() function takes a location as input and retrieves the current weather information for that location using the OpenWeatherMap API.
   - It constructs the API request URL with the provided location and API key, sends a GET request to the API, and parses the JSON response to extract the temperature.
   - The temperature is converted from Kelvin to Celsius and returned as part of the response.

5. *Define Function to Interact with the Chatbot*:
   - The chat_with_bot() function serves as the main interaction loop with the chatbot.
   - It prompts the user to input their message and responds accordingly.
   - If the user input contains the word "weather", it prompts the user to provide their location and retrieves the weather information using the get_weather() function.
   - Otherwise, it uses the respond() method of the chatbot object to generate a response based on the input pattern matching.

6. *Main Function*:
   - The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures that the script is executed only if it is run directly, not if it is imported as a module.
   - It downloads the necessary NLTK data using nltk.download('punkt').
   - Then, it calls the chat_with_bot() function to start the interaction with the chatbot.

*Usage*:
- To use the chatbot, run the script.
- The chatbot will greet the user and prompt them to start chatting.
- The user can input messages, and the chatbot will respond based on the predefined patterns.
- If the user asks about the weather, they need to provide their location, and the chatbot will fetch and display the current temperature for that location.

Overall, the chatbot provides a simple interface for users to interact and obtain weather information for their desired location.
